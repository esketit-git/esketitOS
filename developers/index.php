<p>What we are really looking for is implementation of player vs. player (PVP) gaming. A challenger can put up crypto, if a bout is accepted, they fight and the winner takes the pot in an automatic contract and cheat proof technology.</p> 

<h1>Develop</h1>

<p>Develop is two tier, core development or web development. The core development is done mosty in C/C++, while the web deveopment can utilize all scripting languages such as PHP, Python, Java, Perl and so on.</p>

<p>This is for compatibity reasons, web based technologies are universally compatible. Implementing your protocol over HTTP ensures it is funcational across all systems. Incompatibility is engineered in technology but they bow to Internet compatibility because being incompatibile with the Internet means death of product, so this is where our community develops its technologies. We are not interested in non-web scripting code.</p>

<p>If you can script it, you can call it an app and have it incuded in the coin app store. It can only be downloaded from the app store because esketit.org have to perform a security audit on it to ensure the end user is not open to hacks from the incorperated code.</p>

<p>All scripts must start with <html><head> or they will not display, anything before this is commented out and are where error messages are displayed</p>

<p>The interface looks for index file</p>
<p>The interface looks for icon.png in the main folder</p>
<p>All programs are in their own folder in the programs folder including esketit OS, the interface looks for your folder name in the programs folder to display in the interface</p>
<p>Configuration steps to make the program work are disallowed, the application must work out of the box.</p>
<p>You program is clicked in the your installed apps section of the main interface and displayed in the workspace, one of the seven tabs. These are tabs are saved on logout.</p>
<p>The program you write is up to you.</p>

<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>Download esketit-core and run it</p>

<p>Make a folder call it what you want</p>
<p>Place icon.png and index.ext</p>
<p>Then go to the browser http://127.0.0.1:8332/yourfolder/index.ext</p>
<p>and start developing</p>
<p>When the prgram is ready send it to email@email.com with any isntructions and we will audit it for security and include it soon. Any updates must go through this same process. The file cannot be downoaded outside of this security audit procedure. It is made available in the app shop and user can choose, download from esketit servers and install it.</p>
