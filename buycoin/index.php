<p>The exchanges are too centralized and now governments are again killing people they do not like through banning some users in red tape while fast tracking others, so we must decentralize the exchange system and this application is proposed.</p>

<p>In a decentralized system, their is no person in place for governments to target and compromise. It is peer to peer.</p>

<p>Buy Coin makes bid, buy, sell requests to real peope and filled by real people directly with no exchange in between. A person clicks on a button and places a buy order in the application and a holder of the coin can click a button and fill that order. The orders are collated and the price of the asset is formulated and displayed in real-time.</p>

<p>A smart contract is formed with each transaction and funds exchanged.</p>

<p>The interface is a limited chat room application that only displays relevant bid and buy orders and a button on each one for a seller or buyer to accept. This goes to a seperate page where the contract is formed and assets exchanged. The appliation logs all sales and displays real time prices for each coin that is traded. All prices are set by what a buyer is willing to trade for and what a seller is willing to sell for, and both can click on an order that floats in the chat interface.</p>

<p>This requires no exchange, and so is decetralized.</p>

<p>Building this real peer to peer exhange will take some time. This is where you can find it.</p>

<p>Appearance is key, the P2P must be abstracted, the front end appearance the same as a non p2p exchange service.</p>
