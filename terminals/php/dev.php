EsketitOS is easy to develop for, it is entirey web scripting and simply loads scripts into the main interface. The folder in the dApp section that load a file from the dev directory into the main interface.

Use that file to start dev.

When a user clicks in your icon it loads the index.ext and that is your application.

Supported languages are any web scripting languages such as Java, PHP, Python and so on.

EsektitOS is not a coin, its uses Bitcoin and features of other cryptocurrencies to do work. Core dev it moving parts of bitcoin and other ceryptocurrenies into web scripting form. Blockchains have been programmed in PHP and Python.

The reason for this is that it sits on a HTTP layer ontop of the a hardware layer, so we do not need to program sockets everytime an application requires it.

The HTTP server is called meHS and it made for EsketitOS and applications. MeHs is the network layer but can be the middleman between the hardware layer and the web scripted application.

We do not believe in object orientated programming, we believe in procedural programming. We believe in simple code as the means to keep the development entry level as low as possible.
